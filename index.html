                author: "Albert Einstein",
                field: "Modern Physics",
                explanation: "Einstein believed that being creative and thinking of new ideas is more valuable than just memorizing facts. Facts are limited to what we already know, but imagination lets us discover new things and solve problems we've never seen before."

                field: "Classical Mechanics",
                explanation: "Newton humbly said his discoveries were possible because he learned from great scientists before him. Like standing on a tall person's shoulders lets you see farther, learning from past knowledge helps us make new discoveries."

                field: "Quantum Mechanics",
                explanation: "Becoming an expert means you've tried many things and failed many times in your specialty. These failures taught you what works and what doesn't, making you wise in that area."

                field: "Microbiology",
                explanation: "Scientific discoveries don't belong to just one nation—they benefit all people everywhere. Knowledge is like a light that helps everyone see and understand the world better, no matter where they live."

                field: "Astrophysics",
                explanation: "Scientific facts remain true even if people don't accept them. For example, gravity works whether you believe in it or not. Science is based on evidence and testing, not opinions."

                author: "Marie Curie",
                field: "Radioactivity",
                explanation: "When we learn about things that scare us, they become less frightening. Understanding how things work gives us power and confidence instead of fear."

                author: "Albert Einstein",
                field: "Modern Physics",
                explanation: "Always keep asking questions and being curious about the world. The desire to learn and understand is valuable in itself and drives all human progress."

                field: "Nuclear Physics",
                explanation: "Rutherford jokingly suggested that physics is the most fundamental science because it explains how everything works at the deepest level, while other sciences just categorize and organize things."

                quote: "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.",

                field: "Evolutionary Theory",
                explanation: "Survival isn't about being the biggest or smartest—it's about adapting to new situations. Those who can adjust when their environment changes are the ones who succeed."

                author: "Stephen Hawking",
                field: "Theoretical Physics",
                explanation: "Humans may seem small and insignificant in the vast universe, but our ability to understand complex things like physics and mathematics makes us unique and remarkable."

                field: "Theoretical Physics",
                explanation: "Stay curious about the big questions in life (look at the stars), and keep yourself busy with meaningful work. Having purpose makes life fulfilling."

                field: "Literature/Philosophy",
                explanation: "Having only a small amount of knowledge about something can be harmful because you might think you know more than you do. Either learn deeply about a subject or don't pretend to know it."

                field: "Anthropology",
                explanation: "Good scientists don't just have answers—they know what questions to ask. Asking the right questions is the first step to making important discoveries."

                field: "Medicine",
                explanation: "This ancient medical principle means that before trying to help someone, make sure you don't make things worse. It's better to do nothing than to cause damage."

                field: "Theoretical Physics",
                explanation: "Not knowing something isn't as bad as thinking you know something when you don't. False confidence prevents you from learning the truth."

                field: "Astronomy",
                explanation: "In science, it doesn't matter how many people believe something—what matters is evidence and logical thinking. One person with good evidence is more valuable than a thousand people just following tradition."

                field: "Mathematics/Physics",
